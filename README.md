# UnsyncedBlocks
A Roblox Clone Written In C++ OpenGL
# Whats The Goal Here?
Replicating Early Roblox (2005-2010) With A Twist Of Quake 3 / Unreal Tournament.
# Why Do This?
Well, Pure Boreddom, Sprinkled With Absolute Retardation.
# Why OpenGL Instead Of DirectX?
I Found OpenGL Easier To Work With, And Im Way To Lazy To Convert This To DX Or Equivalent.
